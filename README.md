# Application_Tracker_Database

I began developing this project as a way to help with 3 major goals that I am currently pursuing; 
1. Learning how to design and implement a robust program from scratch
2. Learning SQL
3. Applying to jobs

To this end, Application Tracker Database is a fully functional wrap around for a MySQL Database that holds job application data. 
This database can be updated and queried through the program using SQL and without using SQL.

In the future, I hope to add an additional track that will walk people with no SQL experience through the basics of SQL in order 
to help the utilize both sides of the program. 

The goal of this program is to create a useful tool that anyone of any technical background can use to keep track of the applications 
in their job search.

Notes: 

You will need to have python, MySQL, and MySQL Connector installed before you can run this program. 
You can install them from here:

Python: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

MySQL Community Server (the free version of MySQL):
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

MySQL Connector:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html

Make sure that you update the host, user, and password in the config.ini file 
so that they are equal to the host, user, and password to your MySQL database 
instead of the placeholders [your_host], [your_user], and [your_password].

Otherwise you will get an error.
