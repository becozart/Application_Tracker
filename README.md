# Application_Tracker_Database

You will need to have python, MySQL, and MySQL Connector installed before you can run this program. 
You can install them from here:

Python: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

MySQL Community Server (the free version of MySQL):
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

MySQL Connector:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html

Make sure that you update the host, user, and password in the config.ini file 
so that they are equal to the host, user, and password to your MySQL database 
instead of the placeholders [your_host], [your_user], and [your_password].

Otherwise you will get an error.
